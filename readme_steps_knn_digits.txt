Steps Involved
Import Required Libraries

numpy, matplotlib, seaborn for data manipulation and visualization

sklearn.datasets for loading the digits dataset

sklearn.model_selection for train-test split

sklearn.neighbors for implementing KNN

sklearn.metrics for evaluating performance

Load the Digits Dataset

Load using load_digits() from sklearn.

Each digit is represented by an 8x8 grayscale image (64 features).

Visualize the Data

Display sample images using matplotlib.pyplot.imshow.

Optional: Use a heatmap or grid view for better visualization.

Flatten the Data

The image matrix is flattened into a 1D array of 64 pixel values per image.

Train-Test Split

Use train_test_split to divide data into training and testing sets (commonly 75% train, 25% test).

Train the KNN Classifier

Initialize KNeighborsClassifier with a selected n_neighbors (commonly 3, 5, or 7).

Fit the classifier using knn.fit(X_train, y_train).

Make Predictions

Predict labels for the test set using knn.predict(X_test).

Evaluate the Model

Accuracy score

Confusion matrix

Classification report

Optionally, visualize incorrect predictions or show confusion matrix heatmaps.

Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)

Evaluate model performance by varying k and plotting accuracy vs. k.
