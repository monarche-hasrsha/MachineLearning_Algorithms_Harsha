SVM on Breast Cancer Dataset
Dataset:
Breast Cancer Dataset from sklearn.datasets

Binary classification problem (malignant or benign)

Includes 30 numeric features

Steps Involved:
Import Libraries
Core ML and visualization packages like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn.

Load Dataset
Load using load_breast_cancer() from sklearn.datasets.

Data Exploration

Convert the dataset to a pandas DataFrame for readability.

Check for null values and class distribution.

Visualization

Optional heatmap or count plots to inspect correlations and label counts.

Split Data

Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

Train SVM Classifier

Initialize SVC() with kernel options (linear, rbf, etc.)

Fit the model on training data.

Model Prediction

Use the trained model to predict on the test set.

Evaluation

Classification report

Accuracy score

Confusion matrix

Visualized confusion matrix with seaborn.heatmap
